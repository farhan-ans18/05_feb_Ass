    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. \n",

    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that manipulate that \n",

    "where the internal details of the object are hidden from the outside world \n",
    "and can only be accessed through the object's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. \n",
    "It allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, \n",
    "where a child class can inherit and extend the properties and behaviors of a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same type. \n",
    "It allows for the use of a single interface to represent multiple different implementations of that interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying and defining the essential characteristics \n",
    "of an object or a system, while ignoring the non-essential details. \n",
    "It allows for the creation of simplified models of complex systems, which are easier to understand and work with.\n",
